# If you want to be able to jump to bootloader from firmware on STM32 MCUs,
# set the correct BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS. Either set it here, or define it in
# ./bootloader_defs.h or in ./boards/<FOO>/bootloader_defs.h (if you have
# a custom board definition that you plan to reuse).
# If you're not setting it here, leave it commented out.
# It is chip dependent, the correct number can be looked up here (page 175):
